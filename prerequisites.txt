This Program/Script runs on Python 2.7.12.
I have tested it on linux with Python 2.7.12 and
on windows 10 with Python 2.7.13.

pyRPGDice needs at least Python 2.7.12 and
doesn't run on Python 3.x!!!

So get the needed Python interpreter via your
package managment system (Linux) 
or via www.python.org , there you will find it in the Downloads section (Windows)!!!

If you want to run pyRPGDice on Windows,
use the "Windows Prompt" (German/Deutsch: "Windows Eingabeaufforderung")
Change in the directory of the pyRPGDice.py file, by using
"cd directoryname".
If you are in the correct directory, start the program by
typing ".\pyRPGDice.py parameter"
Eg: ".\pyRPGDice.py 2d6+2d4"
